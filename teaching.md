title: Teaching

I have developed and taught modules and courses in invertebrate and vertebrate zoology, ecology, and marine biology, as well as in data analysis, statistics, and mathematical modelling.

I believe that better integrating quantitative thinking and problem solving into the biological curriculum is a pressing need to ensure tomorrows graduates are well prepared for careers in science and industry, and beyond. To this end, I have been involved in the [Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/), a set of non-profit organisations aiming to not only teach basic research computing and data handling skills, but to also improve the way these skills are taught. I am currently in the process of being trained as a Carpentries instructor.
