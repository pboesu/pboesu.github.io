I am interested in the ecology of oceanic predators and their micronekton prey. My Ph.D. investigated the midwater ecology around Indian Ocean seamounts and atolls and was followed by work on resource allocation strategies in penguins at the British Antarctic Survey. At USF I will study the bioenergetics and foraging strategies of Antarctic albatrosses. My work combines field observations and a variety of statistical and mathematical modelling techniques.
