I am a marine ecologist studying oceanic predators and their micronekton prey. Using a combination of field observations and computational/theoretical approaches, I try to understand the physical and biological processes that shape the distribution and movements of open-ocean animals and their foraging behaviours.

My PhD at the Universities of St Andrews and Oxford investigated the midwater ecology around seamounts and atolls in the Central and Southern Indian Ocean. I then worked on resource allocation strategies in macaroni penguins at the British Antarctic Survey. 

I have recently relocated to the University of South Florida where I study the bioenergetics and foraging strategies of Antarctic albatrosses. This research is funded by the National Science Foundation and conducted in collaboration with scientists at the British Antarctic Survey and the University of Florida. 

Please bear with me while this website evolves.
