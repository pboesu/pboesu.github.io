title: About me
---

I am a quantitative ecologist interested in the processes that shape the distribution and behaviours of animals, and in particular the consequences of dynamic environments for foraging, breeding, and life-history strategies. 
Most of my research to date has combined observational and theoretical approaches to
study animal-environment interactions in marine ecosystems, but I am interested in biological systems of all kinds.

I strongly believe that theory and empirical work must go hand-in-hand to progress ecology as a whole. As such my work has relied on collaborations with researchers across the formulae-to-fieldwork spectrum (viewing myself somewhere near the middle of it), spanning a variety of biological topics, data types, and quantitative approaches. 

I am particularly interested in state-dependent models of individual organisms, and the use of such models as building blocks in coupled models describing population dynamics under climatic and other forcings. My interest in modelling is not limited to ecological applications, but also covers inference approaches for connecting models to data.  

I have a broad set of statistical and computational skills to wrangle and analyse complex datasets and models using both Bayesian and frequentist approaches. I strive to conduct my research in a reproducible fashion, and where possible, I aim to generalise computational solutions to problems from my own work for the use in other fields. While my
current work is exclusively computational, I have organized and conducted extensive fieldwork in marine habitats from the
tropics to the polar zones.
