title: MS/PhD Opportunities in Mathematical Biology and Quantitative Ecology
---

The [Johnson Lab](http://leah.johnson-gramacy.com/) ([Integrative Biology at USF Tampa](http://biology.usf.edu/ib/)) is looking for one or more students (MS or PhD) interested in mathematical biology and quantitative ecology to join the lab beginning Fall 2015. Potential research areas include 

1. the ecology of infectious diseases in humans, plants or animals, such as malaria or chytridiomycosis 
2. modeling individual behavior and life history strategies and the implication of individual traits on population dynamics and persistence, including projects in [dynamic energy budget theory and foraging theory as applied to Antarctic albatrosses](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1341649). 

For more information on what Leah is looking for, and her research interests, see her [website](http://leah.johnson-gramacy.com/prosp.html). 

To assess the overlap in our interests, and your competitiveness for admission to our program, please send a single document to lrjohnson(at)usf.edu, containing: 

1. A letter describing your background and research interests, particularly related to mathematical biology and quantitative ecology;  why you are interested in working with me and in coming to the University of South Florida. 
2. A CV, including: a list of relevant courses (math, stats, computing, and biology); GPA; GRE scores .
3. Contact information (name, email, phone number) for three references. 

Full applications must be submitted through the university website by **February 15, 2015**, although only applications submitted by **January 1, 2015** can be considered for teaching assistant positions.
