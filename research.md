## Seabird Ecology<a name="albatross">&nbsp;</a>
### Bioenergetics and foraging movements of Antarctic albatrosses
<table style="width:80%"><tr><td>
<img class="img-research" src="http://leah.johnson-gramacy.com/albatross/wp-content/gallery/at-sea/JC66-800px-wm-2573.jpg"> Albatrosses are the largest seabirds and top-predators of the open ocean, but their numbers are declining and many species are now endangered. I am using a combination of mathematical and statistical models and several decades of observational data to understand the factors affecting the population dynamics of these birds by studying their bioenergetics and foraging strategies.

### Chick-provisioning in macaroni penguins<a name="weighbridge">&nbsp;</a>
<table style="width:80%"><tr><td>
<img class="img-research" src="/public/images/jumping_out_crop.gif"> With a global population of over 11 million individuals macaroni penguins are not only the most numerous penguins, but also the largest consumers of prey among all seabirds. I am using an automatic weighbridge to study body weights and foraging movements of marked and unmarked penguins at a study colony on Bird Island, South Georgia to better understand how macaronis forage during the breeding season and how they balance provisioning their chicks with the need to maintain their own body condition.

## Bayesian inference for dynamic models of biological systems<a name="deBInfer">&nbsp;</a>
<table style="width:80%"><tr><td>
<img class="img-research" src="http://leah.johnson-gramacy.com/QED/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pretty_pairs_full_model_teixdat_crop-1170x470.jpg"> Differential equations (DEs) are commonly used to model the temporal evolution of dynamic
systems in science and engineering, but statistical methods for comparing DE models to data
and for parameter inference are relatively poorly developed. This is especially problematic in
the presence of latent model states or parameters, when observations are noisy or when only a
small number of observed time points are available.<br>
Bayesian approaches offer a coherent framework for parameter inference that can account for
multiple sources of uncertainty, while making use of prior information. This approach further
offers a rigorous methodology modeling the link between unobservable model states and
parameters, and observable quantities.

## Ecology of seamounts and islands <a name="seamounts">&nbsp;</a>
<table style="width:80%"><tr><td>
<img class="img-research" src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/51453000/gif/_51453465_pic6.gif">Seamounts and islands protrude into the open ocean, introducing hard boundaries to an otherwise largely unbounded habitat. Above water, they offer breeding habitat for air-breathing marine predators such as seabirds and seals. Below the waves, the abrupt topography can trap small pelagic animals, exposing them to predators and/or concentrating them on island slopes and the summits and flanks of submarine banks. I have studied seabird assemblages on islands, as well as the effect of abrupt topography on the distribution of pelagic biota and their predator-prey interactions.

## Open ocean ecology<a name="SLs">&nbsp;</a>
### Oceanic scattering layers
<table style="width:80%"><tr><td>
<img class="img-research" src="/public/images/DVM38kHz.jpg">A substantial proportion of biomass below the photic zone is concentrated in so called sound scattering layers which can be observed with echosounders. Scattering layers are often species-rich and include animals like laternfishes, squids and deep-water prawns. They are an important prey source for predators such as tuna, oceanic sharks and marine mammals. They also play an important role in marine biogeochemical cycles. I have studied the distribution and biogeographic zonation of scattering layers in the southern Indian Ocean.
