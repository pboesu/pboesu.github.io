<img class="img-port" src="/public/images/alexsingleton.jpg"></img>In a general sense I am concerned with how  social and spatial complexities of individual behaviours can be represented and understood within a framework of quantitative social science and computer modelling.

In particular, my research has extended a geographic tradition of area classification and I have developed a broad critique of the ways in which geodemographic methods can be refined through modern scientific approaches to data mining, geographic information science and quantitative human geography.
