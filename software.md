title: Research Software

The computational tools I develop in my own work are often useful beyond that particular question. I aim to generalize these solutions for the use in other fields, and package them as open research software. You can follow my software development activity on [github](https://github.com/pboesu).



## Software packages I am a lead developer for

[deBInfer: Bayesian inference for dynamical models of biological systems in R](https://github.com/pboesu/debinfer) (with SJ Ryan and LR Johnson)<br>
An R framework for Bayesian parameter inference in ordinary and delay differential equation models.<br>
[![Project Status: Active - The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#active)
[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/deBInfer)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=deBInfer)

[rucrdtw](https://github.com/pboesu/rucrdtw)<br>
Fast time series subsequence search under dynamic time warping in R. This package provides R bindings for functions from the [UCR Suite](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/UCRsuite.html). <br>

[seabirdeb](https://github.com/pboesu/seabirdeb)<br>
This R package provides compiled dynamic energy budget models for seabirds. <br>
[![Project Status: WIP - Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

[microclimloggers](https://github.com/RyanLab/ryanlabloggers)<br>
This package provides functions to parse and reshape microclimate logger data (e.g. iButton Hygrochron, HOBO pendant loggers). <br>

## Other contributions

Software is fundamental to modern ecological research, yet it is poorly integrated in todays scholarly practice, and receives little acknowledgement in the scholarly record. I strongly believe that research software should be treated on the same basis as other scholarly products such as papers, books, and data sets. Research software deserves peer-review and citations. 

I strive to support sustainable research software development as a reviewer and contributor to the digital infrastructure for the [Journal of Open Research Software](http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/) and the [Journal of Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.com/). Many of my contributions are public on [github](https://github.com/pboesu).
