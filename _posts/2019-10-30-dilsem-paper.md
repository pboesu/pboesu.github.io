A new paper led by Nick Isaac and Bob O'Hara on data integration approaches for biodiversity records has just been published in Trends in Ecology and Evolution: [Data Integration for Large-Scale Models of Species Distributions](https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(19)30255-1). 

This review article highlights novel analysis approaches, conceptually based on point-process models, to better understand species distributions by integrating data from a wide variety of surveys and other citizen science projects.
