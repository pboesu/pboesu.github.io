Another bit of my PhD research has been accepted for publication! A short paper describes our finding of enhanced pelagic biomass around coral atolls. It will appear in Marine Ecology Progress Series later this Spring. 

In the meantime, you can read the abstract [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps11675) and check out the [prepress PDF](http://127.0.0.1:4000/public/MEPS_BIOT_prepress.pdf).
