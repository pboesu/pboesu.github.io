New preprint with [Leah Johnson](http://leah.johnson-gramacy.com) on Bayesian inference methods for differential equation models of biological systems: [deBInfer: Bayesian inference for dynamical models of biological systems in R](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00021). Our paper describes an R package for implementing these kinds of analyses. The package itself is still pretty rough around the edges, but the development version is available from [github](https://github.com/pboesu/debinfer), and includes a vignette featuring a worked example.
