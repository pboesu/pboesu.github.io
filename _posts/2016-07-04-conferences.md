We have been busy spreading the word about our new R package for implementing Bayesian inference for differential equation models. Our <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3466400.v2">poster from the 2016 meeting of the International Society of Bayesian Analysis</a> and <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3469382.v2">slides from Leah's talk at the International Statistical Ecology Conference</a> are now available on figshare.  For more detail have a look at the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00021">arXiv preprint</a>, or better yet, download the package from <a href="https://github.com/pboesu/debinfer">github</a>, and try it.

At ISEC we also presented a <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3466403.v1">poster featuring some early results on our work on albatross movement models</a>, and their identifiability when using data from different generations of biologgers.
