I am beyond thrilled to have been awarded a travel scholarship by the Enderby Trust, to go on a trip to the sub-Antarctic islands of New Zealand. In mid-December I will be visiting Tini Heke (Snares Island), Motu Maha (Auckland Islands), and Motu Ihupuku (Campbell Island), and -- weather allowing -- some of the seabird colonies on them. I am very excited to get this chance to see the species I am modelling in their natural habitats.

I will not be able to update the blog during the expedition, as there is no regular internet connection on the vessel. The vessel position and cccasional updates from the expedition leader can be found at [http://www.heritage-expeditions.com/captains-blog/](http://www.heritage-expeditions.com/captains-blog/).
