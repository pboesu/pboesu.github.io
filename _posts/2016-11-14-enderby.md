I am beyond thrilled to have been awarded a travel scholarship by the Enderby Trust, to go on a trip to the sub-Antarctic islands of New Zealand. In mid-December I will be visiting Tini Heke (Snares Island), Motu Maha (Auckland Islands), and Motu Ihupuku (Campbell Island), and -- weather allowing -- some of the seabird colonies on them. I am very excited to get this chance to see the species I am modelling in their natural habitats.
