A new research paper published with BTO colleagues underlines the importance of rocky shores and sandy beaches for waterbirds in the UK.
The study summarised the results of a citizen science survey scheme - the third Non-Estuarine Waterbird Survey (NEWS III). 

The results showed that Oystercatcher was the most abundant species on the open coast, followed by Curlew and Turnstone. Four species - Lapwing, Curlew, Redshank and Turnstone - showed significant abundance declines since the previous survey (NEWS II) in winter 2006/07. A single species -  Sanderling - had significantly increased in abundance. 

All UK countries have non-estuarine coastal stretches which support high densities of waders, with Scotland being particularly important. Further notable areas are located in north-east England, Orkney, North Wales and Outer Ards in Northern Ireland.

The study was led by Liz Humphries and is published in the journal *Bird Study*:
