A new paper with [Leah Johnson](http://leah.johnson-gramacy.com) on Bayesian inference in Dynamic Energy Budget models has just been published in the Journal of Sea Research: [Two case studies detailing Bayesian parameter inference for dynamic energy budget models](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2018.07.014). 

Our paper walks through two case studies to illustrate how the parameters for two different types of dynamic energy budget models can be inferred from data using the [deBInfer R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deBInfer/).

An open access preprint can be found on [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/259705) and the code underlying the paper is archived on [zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1298407).
