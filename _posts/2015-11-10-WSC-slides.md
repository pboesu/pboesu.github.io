An early snapshot of our work on Dynamic Energy Budget models for albatrosses was presented at the 2nd World Seabird Conference in Cape Town, South Africa. The slides of my talk "Unravelling physiological and ecological determinants of albatross chick growth" can be found <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1591048">on figshare</a>.
