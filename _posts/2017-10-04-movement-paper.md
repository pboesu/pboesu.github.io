New paper published on model and parameter identifiability in random walk models:

Our new paper [Changing measurements or changing movements? Sampling scale and movement model identifiability across generations of biologging technology](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3461) asks the question whether it is possible to compare flight-length data obtained decades apart by different generations of biologging technology. 
We found that care must be taken when comparing data collected at differing timescales, even when using inference procedures that incorporate the observational process, as model selection and parameter estimation may be biased. As a result comparisons may only be valid when degrading all data to match the lowest resolution in a set.

This study was led by [Leah Johnson](http://leah.johnson-gramacy.com/QED/) and conducted in collaboration with [Sadie Ryan](http://www.sadieryan.net/), [Richard Phillips](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/raphil/), and myself.
