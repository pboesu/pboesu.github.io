New paper published on resource competition between seabirds and fisheries:

 [Best Practices for Assessing Forage Fish Fisheries - Seabird Resource Competition](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.05.018) originated out of two workshops following the 2nd World Seabird Conference in 2015. The paper reviews approaches used to study fisheriesâˆ’seabird resource competition, highlights strengths and weaknesses of observational and modelling approaches, and outlines best practices for future studies of this complex issue. 
This collaborative effort of 29 authors was lead by [Bill Sydeman and Sarah Ann Thompson from the Farallon Institute](http://www.faralloninstitute.org/).
