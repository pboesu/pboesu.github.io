<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=deBInfer"><img src="http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/deBInfer" width="82" height="20" alt="CRAN Badge" class="alignleft size-large" /></a>

We are very excited to announce the initial CRAN release of our R package for Bayesian inference in differential equation models. At this point we consider the package API stable, and we will strive to preserve backwards compatibility in future releases. Also included in the CRAN release are three vignettes covering example applications for ODEs and DDEs.

The CRAN version of the package can be found at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=deBInfer">https://cran.r-project.org/package=deBInfer</a> and the package can be installed in R with thecommand <code>install.packages("deBInfer")</code>.

We continue to work on the package, and a development version is available at <a href="https://github.com/pboesu/debinfer">https://github.com/pboesu/debinfer</a> it can be installed directly from github using the devtools package:
<code>
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pboesu/debinfer")
</code>

HTML help files for the development version, and the most recent versions of the vignettes are available at <a href="http://pboesu.github.io/debinfer">http://pboesu.github.io/debinfer</a>

Background on the methods implemented in deBInfer can be found in our preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00021" target="_blank">deBInfer: Bayesian inference for dynamical models of biological systems in R</a>
