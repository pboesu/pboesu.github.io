The logo may look like a songbird, but seabirds, too, have a strong following on twitter, too! After a successful first incarnation in 2015, the World Seabird Union organized another Twitter Conference this year, the 2nd World Seabird Twitter conference. This year over 70 seabird researchers from all over the globe tweeted about their work, each "Talk" consisting of six tweets, and in the process reached a total of over 2 million twitter users worldwide. You can find a complete record of all talks on <a href="https://storify.com/mfczap/wstc2">Storify</a>

Our contribution on mechanistic models for <a href="http://leah.johnson-gramacy.com/albatross/">albatross growth and bioenergetics</a> is summarized below.
