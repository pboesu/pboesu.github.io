New preprint with the [Ryan Lab](http://www.sadieryan.net/) on human biting rates of three mosquito taxa: [Quantifying Seasonal and Diel Variation in Anopheline and Culex Human Biting Rates in Southern Ecuador](https://doi.org/10.1101/192773). 

Our paper uses hurdle models  to determine if biting activity was fundamentally different for different taxa, and to identify temporal and spatial factors influencing bite rate. Biting trends varied significantly among species and time. All taxa exhibited exophagic feeding behavior, and outdoor locations increased both the odds and incidence of bites across taxa.
