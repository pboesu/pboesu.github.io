New preprint with the [Ryan Lab](http://www.sadieryan.net/) on human biting rates of three mosquito taxa: [Quantifying Seasonal and Diel Variation in Anopheline and Culex Human Biting Rates in Southern Ecuador](https://doi.org/10.1101/192773). Our paper uses hurdle models  to determine if biting activity was fundamentally different for different taxa, and to identify temporal factors influencing bite rate.
