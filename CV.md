### CV LaTex Template

My CV was written in [LaTex](http://www.latex-project.org) and was based on a template I found [here](http://texblog.org/2012/04/25/writing-a-cv-in-latex/).

I have extended this so all my publications are rendered from separate [Bibtex](http://www.bibtex.org) reference lists. Feel free to download the source files if you think these are helpful - [CV Source](/public/downloads/CV_Source_2_1_14.zip)
